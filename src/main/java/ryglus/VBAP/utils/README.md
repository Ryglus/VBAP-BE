# Utility Classes

This folder is dedicated to utility classes in our Spring Boot application.

## Overview

Utility classes, often marked with the `@Component` annotation in Spring Boot, are classes that provide various utility methods that are used across the application. These methods are usually static and help in reducing code duplication and increasing reusability.

## Structure

Each utility class should be focused on a specific type of utility. For example, a `StringUtils` class would contain methods related to string manipulation. The class name should clearly reflect the type of utility methods it contains.

## Usage

To use a utility method, simply call it from the class where you need it:

```java
String result = StringUtils.capitalize("hello world");
